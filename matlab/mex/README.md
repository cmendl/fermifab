C source code of the FermiFab toolbox (Matlab MEX interface) 
============================================================

To compile the code, first make sure that MEX has been properly configured for your system (`mex -setup`), and then call `build_mex.m` from Matlab.
The source code documentation in the 'doc' subfolder is generated by [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org).
